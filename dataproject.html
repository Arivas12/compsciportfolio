     <h1>Data Project</h1>
       <h3>The Problem</h3>
       <p>The problem is that schools are required to serve students lunches, but the lunches that the school serve do not taste very good. Because students 
         are not eating school served lunches, schools are creating more waste and also spending more money than they should be on food that students do not want to eat. 
         Our target audience will be schools accross America, students that eat these lunches, and their parents. A data driven prediction can help us predict what types of lunches students prefer to eat. </p>
       <h3>The Data</h3>
       <p>We collected data by asking students that are in middle and high school what type of lunches they prefer to eat, whether they like healthy lunches, better tasting lunches, or they have no preference. 
         This type of information is called survey. We had middle and high school students take a multiple choice survey on whether they prefer healthy lunches, better tasting lunches, or they don't care what type of lunch they eat. </p>

       <h3>Cleaning data and errors</h3>
       <p>We did not need to clean any data because we made it a multiple choice survey. This means that they had to choose one of the three answers we provided, which means that we didn't need to clean the data. 
         The only possible source of bad data is the possibility of a surveyer purposely putting an answer that they don't agree with. </p>
       <h3>Using the Data</h3>
       <p>We will use the data we collected by giving it to schools and posting it online for people to see the results. This hopefully will let schools know what the students believe is the best solution for school lunches. 
         Decision making can be automated by using the algorithm, "whatever solution has the most votes in the survey, should be served in schools" Decision making can be automatic because the data is based on facts and data from students themselves. 
         However, there can be drawbacks from the automated systems because this does not apply to all students. </p>
