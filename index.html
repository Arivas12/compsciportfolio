     <h1> Purpose Paragraph </h1>
       <p> Hello, I'm Andres Rivas and this is my personal website. The purpose of this website is to be a place where I can store all of the
  things that I learned while taking this computer science course. This website was created using HTML and CSS. This website has two pages.
  One of them explains a little bit about me, and the other page shows off the projects I've done during the duration of this course. </p>
