     <h1>About Me</h1>
     <p>As a computer science student, I am still very inexperienced at all the different things that have to do with computer science. 
       This is my first ever class with computer science, which means that I have not done any big computer science projects prior to this website. Right now, I am fluent in 
     two languages which are Chinese and English, while I still know a bit of spanish. I am currently continueing learning chinese as well.</p>

     <p>The reason I chose to take this computer science course is because I wanted to have more information about computer science before I take a
     harder course during the school year. I want to get the feel for computer science before I dive straight into it during school. 
     I am very excited to learn about all the different and cool things that you can do just by knowing how to program a computer</p>
